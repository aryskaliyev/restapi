### API

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a **set of rules and protocols** that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs define how different components of software systems should interact, specifying the types of requests that can be made, the format of the data to be sent, and the expected responses.

REST API (RESTful API), which stands for Representational State Transfer API, is a particular **architectural style for designing networked applications**. It is based on a set of principles and constraints that promote scalability, simplicity, and interoperability. REST APIs use the HTTP protocol as their underlying communication protocol and leverage its methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform different operations on resources.

REST APIs operate on the concept of resources, which are typically represented as URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). Each resource has a unique URL, and different operations can be performed on these resources by sending appropriate HTTP requests to their respective URLs.
